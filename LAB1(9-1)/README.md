# Deep Learning Lab – Assignment 1

This assignment introduces fundamental deep learning concepts using PyTorch and TensorFlow. It covers tensor initialization, data types, basic tensor operations, reshaping, indexing, and automatic differentiation using PyTorch Autograd, along with linear algebra operations using TensorFlow.

Logical gates and neural network models are implemented to understand learning capabilities.

Results:
- AND and OR gates were successfully implemented using a single-layer perceptron, producing correct truth table outputs.
- The XOR problem was solved using a multi-layer neural network in PyTorch, demonstrating that non-linearly separable problems require hidden layers.
- A simple neural network was implemented for a regression task, where training loss consistently decreased and predicted values closely matched the actual values.
